Description: cosmopy is a python package that computes the many cosmological
                 distances for Lambda non-zero cosmology, such as the
                 luminosity, angular and comoving distances at a given
                 redshift. It also computes the age of the universe, the
                 look-back time and the age of galaxy for a given redshift of
                 formation. cosmopy follows the definitions from Hogg (1998)
                 astro-ph/9905116.
